Lakes
=======================


Current features:  
-polygon lakes based on distorted ellipsoids  
-underground and surface lakes  

Known issues:  
-Missing biome modification to prevent grass and trees to spawn on lakes  
~~-surface lakes have difficulties appearing in perlin and other non flat world gens (unknown reason)~~
-the "tubs" of surface lakes are sometimes incomplete  

Future plans:  
-join adjacent surface lakes together to one waterheight
-add lake biome
-base lake probability  
-add additional probability for lakes to spawn in caves
-add an air layer for underground lakes above the watersurface
